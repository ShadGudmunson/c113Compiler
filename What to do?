Homework 6:
Start at the leaves, a.k.a. basis cases.

    Fill in attributes, possibly one at a time.
    For example, assign .addr values for everything.
    Allocate all your labels and temporary variables
    Assign .true and .false fields in your condition exprs 

To calculate .addr:
    Look in global symbol table for anything that has type FUNC 
    Find parameters and type/size
    Find local type/size variables (in symbol table)
    Calculate intermediate/temp variables start (after params and local)
    NOTE: might want to add a .region

.code is empty for leafs


Constants can just be const:<num>

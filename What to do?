====FIXED=====EVERYTHING IS BROKEN BECAUSE YOU CHANGED THE TYPE IN SYMTAB TO ACTUALLY BE A TYPE. NEED TO SWITCH OVER ALL OF THE CALLS TO INSERT TO FOLLOW THIS NOW. 
====FIXED=====      - #includes
====FIXED=====      - fix count parameters
====FIXED=====      -   Fix Names
====FIXED=====      - Adjust returntype to make sure pointers are different than basetypes.
====FIXED=====        - Check # of parameters on insert
====FIXED=====        - Check parameters on insert


====FIXED=====CURRENTLY FIGHTING WITH TYPEPTR VS TYPEPTR * FOR RETURN TYPE OF TFI AND INPUT OF INSERT
    
====FIXED=====    Check that function call signatures match
====FIXED=====        - Build call parameters
====FIXED=====        - Check parameters are the same types as specified in the symboltable
====FIXED=====    Check that operators' operands are compatible
====FIXED=====        CURRENTLY HAVE STRICT TYPE CHECKING (i.e. int = int + int is okay but int = float + int is not)

====FIXED=====    constants dont seem to be having their type assinged properly.

====FIXED=====        - Create function that passes in the operator and the types of the operands
====FIXED=====        - Create a switch based on the operator and have a list of operand types that are allowed.
====FIXED=====    Allow prototypes and check against function definition 

====FIXED=====    Change symbol table to use new type's instead of strings.
    Fix arrays
    Fix structs
====FIXED=====    Adjust print to include return type for functions
====FIXED=====    Clear symboltables inbetween files
